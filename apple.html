      <h2>Apple hates you.</h2>
      <p>Apple has strict codesign enforcements about applications. This means that Apple does allow sideloading, but it does come with restrictions.</p>

      <h2>Developer Certificates</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>An Apple ID has two different types of accounts; paid and free. As the name suggests, the free one is the default account you get for every Apple ID. However, it comes with restrictions.</p>
        <p>With a free developer certificate, there are some rules you must follow. You are only allowed to install up to 3 apps at a time. Additionally, all installed apps must be refreshed every 7 days. Sideloaders, such as SideStore, have surpassed this restriction by refreshing in the background without a USB connection or computer.</p>
        <p>Developer accounts are different on the other hand. Developer certificates surpass all those restrictions. Users can install unlimited applications, refresh every 365 days, but you have to pay $99 USD yearly. Services, such as Kravasign, mass distribute these developer certificates for an extremely cheap price. This is because one paid developer account can distribute 100 certificates.</p>
      </ul>

          <h2>Enterprise Certificates</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>Enterprise certificates are certificates created for companies. They typically have a lot of work phones to install third party apps provided by their own company. Enterprise certificates are generated from an Apple Enterprise Developer Program account, which can generate an unlimited amount of certificates.</p>
        <p>Users often take advantage of the benefit that enterprise certificates have absolutely no restriction on sideloading (other than entitlement permission). Therefore, users leak enterprise certificates to the public and anybody can get access to these certificates.</p>
        <p>You might be wondering if Apple catches onto this. They do. Infact, Apple has to revoke certificates because they were being overused and abused by users. In some cases, users can be blacklisted by certificates. Blacklists can be semi-prevented by installing a DNS which blocks Apple's domains from reaching your device, but Apple often uses new domains to overcome this. On some iOS versions, it is possible to remove blacklists.</p>
        <p>Because of Apple detecting lots of traffic from new incoming users, they have easy access to revoke the certificate. This is why enterprise signing nowadays is extremely unreliable. Blacklists are also highly unpredictable and require a device restore in order to remove it. Some tools can remove it, such as BlacklistBeGone. However, your firmware version must be vulernable to certain exploits. A DNS method can be used to prevent blacklists, but cannot be removed with a DNS.</p>
        <p>An anti-revoke DNS (Domain Name Server) redirects Apple's domains that are responsible for blacklisting users. The only disadvantage is that Apple does introduce new domains.</p>
      </ul>
