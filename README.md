# Website Documentation

**Contributors please follow this guide.**
**See other important gudies, such as [common phrases.](https://github.com/Jotwyn/jotwyn.github.io/blob/main/readmeto.md)**

Each folder contains html files for each guide in their respective category.

Each html starts with the following format:

a01.html

"a" = change to the FIRST letter of the parsnt folder

"01" = change to the amount of HTML files in that current folder.

**Example:**

*u0.html* = U = utillties*

The only exception is if in a folder, two sub folders have the same name. This is an example in Signers>Jailed & Singers>Jailbreak. 

In this scenario, seek documentation below for sub names to use instead of the directory.

Jailbroken = jb

Jailed = j

# Sideloading Utilities 

u01.html - Start
Cowabunga - iOS 15 - 16.1.2

Uses the MacDirtyCow exploit to get rid of blacklists. Not recommended as it required to sideload an application. Also bypasses three app limit. These features are useless because of TrollStore.

BlacklistBeGone - iOS 17.0 - 18.0.1

Removes blacklists using the sparserestore exploit. May result in bootloops. 

SparseBox - iOS 16 - 18.0 RC / 18.1 beta 4. (17.7.1 not included)

Removes the three app limit. Still limited to 10 app ID’s. Requires you to have find my disabled at all times. Every 3 apps installed requires you to re-run the exploit.

LiveContainer

An app launcher allowing you to run an iOS application within an iOS application. This is not an emulator or hypervisor. Supports unlimited apps with tweak injection and more features. Highly recommended for SideStore users.

WDBRemoveThreeAppLimit

Uses the MDC exploit to remove the three app limit. Still limited to 10 app ID’s.
