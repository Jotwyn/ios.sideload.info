Website Documentation

Each folder contains html files for each guide in their respective category.

Each html starts with the following format:

a01.html

"a" = change to the FIRST letter of the parsnt folder

"01" = change to the amount of HTML files in that current folder.

**Example:**

*u0.html* = U = utillties*

The only exception is if in a folder, two sub folders have the same name. This is an example in Signers>Jailed & Singers>Jailbreak. 

In this scenario, seek documentation below for sub names to use instead of the directory.

Jailbroken = jb

Jailed = j
