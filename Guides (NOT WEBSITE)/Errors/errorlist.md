# Error List

## Enterprise Certificates

We will go over common errors in sideloading and will go over fixes.

**App integrity cannot be verified.**

This means the certificate you are using is revoked. There are no fixes other than installing Appsync Unified *and you must be jailbroken.*

**An internet connection is required to...**

You have been blacklisted from the certificate. Blacklists are randomized and happen at any given time while using a certificate. 

Fixing blacklists involve using BlacklistBeGone or Cowabunga, which erase the blacklist. *Cowabunga requires you to sideload an application, which isnt very ideal to use.*

**My app launches, but then crashes almost instantly.**

This can be several reasons, but the most logical reason is that the certificate is revoked. In some cases, apps may launch bypassing the revoke error, but then crash.
